            <p>Hircine, the Spirit of the Hunt's past, leads many to argue. He himself was never mentioned or heard of in the early histories of Nirn. Some scholars believe because of this that Hircine was not one of the original Daedric Princes and is, therefore, a spawn or offshoot, similar to Malacath. However this is often shunned on account of Hircine creating Lycanthropes, and the disease existing well into the Merethic Era. Hircine also appears within the mortal realm once every thousand years; but not to destroy, like some princes, but to enjoy a great hunt known as the Bloodmoon Prophecy. </p>
